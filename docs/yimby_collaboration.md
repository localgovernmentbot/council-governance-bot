# Collaboration Proposal for YIMBY Melbourne

## Draft Message

Subject: BlueSky Integration for Council Meeting Transparency

Hi YIMBY Melbourne team,

I'm working on improving council meeting transparency in Victoria and came across your excellent council-meeting-agenda-scraper project. Your work on scraping Victorian council websites is exactly what the community needs.

I've developed a BlueSky posting module that could complement your scrapers by automatically posting meeting agendas and minutes to social media, increasing visibility of council activities.

**What I'm proposing:**
- Use your scraper patterns (with full attribution) for councils you've already implemented
- Contribute any new council scrapers I develop back to your project
- Offer the BlueSky integration module as a PR to your repository
- Maintain clear attribution to YIMBY Melbourne in any public bot

**The bot would:**
- Post as "VicCouncilBot" or similar (not tied to any individual)
- Include links to source documents
- Use consistent hashtags for discoverability
- Clearly state it's an automated community service

Would you be open to this collaboration? I want to ensure I'm respecting your work and contributing back to the community in a meaningful way.

Best regards,
[A Victorian transparency advocate]
