- Bio: Link to main repo

## 3. Transfer/Fork Repository

2. Create new repo under bot account
3. Keep under your account but make it clear it's the bot's project

## 4. Update Repository

- Add ATTRIBUTION.md

```

## 6. Initial Posts

First post from bot:
"üèõÔ∏è Victorian Council Bot is now active! I'll be posting meeting agendas and minutes from Victorian councils to improve government transparency. Starting with Melbourne and Darebin councils. Open source: [github link] #VicCouncils #OpenGov"

## 7. Deployment Options

- GitHub Actions (free, already set up)
- Small VPS under bot identity

This keeps everything under the bot's identity, not yours.
