## Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the excellent work of:
- [YIMBY Melbourne's council-meeting-agenda-scraper](https://github.com/yimbymelbourne/council-meeting-agenda-scraper)
- Used under [their license] with modifications

## Collaboration

We've added BlueSky posting functionality and welcome contributions!
```

**In bot profile:**
- Link to GitHub showing it's open source
- Clear that it's automated/not official

## Technical Separation

1. **Separate GitHub account** for the bot project
2. **Dedicated email** for the bot
3. **API keys** in bot's name, not personal
4. **Hosting** under bot identity if deployed

This keeps you as a contributor but not the face of the project.
