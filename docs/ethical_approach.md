# Ethical Integration Plan for Council Transparency Bot

## Approach

1. **Respect YIMBY Melbourne's License**
   - Check their LICENSE file first
   - Give proper attribution
   - Follow their contribution guidelines

2. **Bot Identity**
   - Name: "VicCouncilBot" or "LocalGovBot"
   - Bio: "Automated transparency for Victorian council meetings. Posts agendas & minutes to improve civic engagement."
   - Not tied to personal identity

3. **Collaboration Offer**
   - Create a BlueSky posting module they can integrate
   - Offer it as a pull request to their project
   - Share any improvements we make to their scrapers

## Steps

1. Clone and examine their repo
2. Check license and contribution guidelines
3. Use their scrapers with proper attribution
4. Build BlueSky integration as a separate module
5. Offer the integration back to them

## Bot Ethics

- Only post public documents
- Respect rate limits
- Include source attribution

- Provide value to the community
