# Attribution and Acknowledgments

## YIMBY Melbourne

This project gratefully acknowledges and builds upon the work of YIMBY Melbourne's council-meeting-agenda-scraper project:
https://github.com/yimbymelbourne/council-meeting-agenda-scraper

Their pioneering work in scraping Victorian council meetings has provided invaluable patterns and approaches that we've adapted for the M9 councils.

## Key Adaptations

While YIMBY Melbourne focuses on housing advocacy, this project extends their work to:
- Cover all council business for transparency
- Add AI-powered summarization of significant items
- Integrate with BlueSky for public dissemination
- Publish open datasets under Creative Commons

## Contributing Back

We are committed to contributing improvements back to the YIMBY Melbourne project, including:
- Bug fixes discovered in M9 scrapers
- Enhanced error handling
- Documentation improvements
- General scraper enhancements

## Differences in Approach

Our modifications include:
- Broader scope beyond planning matters
- Focus on all significant council decisions
- Integration with social media for transparency
- Open data publishing component

## License Compliance

We use patterns and approaches inspired by YIMBY Melbourne's work while maintaining our own implementation. Any direct code usage is marked with appropriate attribution.
