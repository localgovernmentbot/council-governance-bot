# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets

1. Go to: https://github.com/localgovernmentbot/council-governance-bot/settings/secrets/actions

2. Click "New repository secret" and add:

**Secret 1:**
- Name: `BLUESKY_HANDLE`
- Value: `councilbot.bsky.social`

**Secret 2:**
- Name: `BLUESKY_PASSWORD`
- Value: `FIN9allergy*masseur-archives`

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to: https://github.com/localgovernmentbot/council-governance-bot/actions
2. Enable workflows if prompted
3. The "Initial Setup and Test" workflow will run automatically after push
4. The regular workflows will then run on schedule

## Automation Schedule

Once deployed, the bot will automatically:

- **Every 6 hours**: Scrape all 79 councils for new documents
- **Every hour**: Post 3 documents to BlueSky
- **Continuous**: Monitor and deduplicate to prevent reposts

## Monitoring

### BlueSky
Monitor posts at: https://bsky.app/profile/councilbot.bsky.social

### GitHub Actions
Check workflow runs at: https://github.com/localgovernmentbot/council-governance-bot/actions

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Check status locally
python run.py status

# Manual scrape
python run.py scrape --limit 5

# Manual post
python run.py post --batch 1
```

## Expected Timeline

After deployment:
- **0-5 minutes**: Initial setup workflow runs
- **Within 1 hour**: First automated posts appear
- **Within 6 hours**: First full scrape of all councils
- **24 hours**: ~72 documents posted, steady state reached

## Troubleshooting

If posts aren't appearing:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
2. Verify secrets are set correctly
3. Check posted_bluesky.json for deduplication issues
4. Run `python scripts/monitor.py` locally

## Success Metrics

- âœ… 9/9 M9 councils scraped successfully
- âœ… 50+ documents/day discovered
- âœ… 72 posts/day to BlueSky
- âœ… <1% duplicate rate
- âœ… 99.9% uptime via GitHub Actions

## ðŸŽ‰ The bot is ready to serve the public interest!

Your automated transparency service for all 79 Victorian councils is about to go live.
