RECOMMENDATION:
With 318 documents from 6 councils, we have a solid foundation to:
1. Implement PDF text extraction
2. Add AI summarization for significant items
3. Set up BlueSky posting
4. Demonstrate the system works

The 3 remaining councils can be addressed later with more advanced techniques.
