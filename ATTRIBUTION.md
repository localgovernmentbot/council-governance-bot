## YIMBY Melbourne Council Scrapers

This project uses patterns and approaches inspired by YIMBY Melbourne's council-meeting-agenda-scraper:
https://github.com/yimbymelbourne/council-meeting-agenda-scraper

Their project has done excellent work creating scrapers for Victorian councils to support housing advocacy.

## Our Approach

1. We've studied their scraper patterns to understand best practices
2. We've built our own implementation following similar approaches
3. We're adding BlueSky posting functionality
4. We aim to contribute back to the community

## Differences

- Our scrapers are independently written
- We focus on social media posting for transparency
- We use a different tracking system for posted documents
- Our bot operates as an independent community service

## Community Collaboration

We welcome collaboration and are happy to:
- Share our BlueSky posting module
- Contribute any new council scrapers we develop
- Work together on improving council transparency
