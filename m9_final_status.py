M9 COUNCIL BOT - FINAL STATUS
=============================

WORKING COUNCILS (5/9):
✓ Melbourne      - 8 documents   (minutes only)
✓ Darebin        - 25 documents  (agendas & minutes)
✓ Hobsons Bay    - 25 documents  (agendas & minutes) [PRIORITY]
✓ Maribyrnong    - 16 documents  (agendas & minutes)
✓ Merri-bek      - 226 documents (agendas & minutes)

TOTAL: 300 documents from 5/9 councils
SUCCESS RATE: 56% of councils

PROBLEMATIC COUNCILS (4/9):
✗ Moonee Valley  - Requires JavaScript/Selenium
✗ Yarra          - Blocks automated requests (403)
✗ Port Phillip   - Times out
✗ Stonnington    - Can't find meeting content

RECOMMENDATION:
Proceed with the 300 documents we have. This is enough to:
- Test PDF extraction
- Implement AI summarization  
- Set up BlueSky posting
- Demonstrate the system works

We can return to the remaining 4 councils later with more sophisticated approaches.
